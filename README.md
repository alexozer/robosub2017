# CUAUV RoboSub 2017 Artemis Autonomous Tasks

A snapshot of my implementation of the autonomous tasks for CUAUV's Artemis
submarine in RoboSub 2017. Included is mission and machine vision
implementations for the Recovery, Torpedoes, and Bins tasks, plus contributions
to the mission framework including a high-dimensional point set matcher/tracker
and "volatile task combinators".

Artemis alone scored ~11,000 points in Semifinal I, which is ~2.5 times as many
points as that of any other team's run at RoboSub 2017. Artemis and Apollo
(CUAUV's mini submarine) combined earned first place by scoring the highest in
finals.
