# CUAUV RoboSub 2017 Artemis Autonomous Tasks

A snapshot of my implementation of the autonomous tasks for CUAUV's Artemis
submarine in RoboSub 2017. Included is mission and machine vision
implementations for the Recovery, Torpedoes, and Bins tasks, plus contributions
to the mission framework including a high-dimensional point set matcher/tracker
and "volatile task combinators".

The team scored first place overall at RoboSub 2017. We also performed very
well in Semifnal I, with Artemis alone scoring roughly 2.5 times as many points
as that of any other team's run.
